To use the images in your game project, make sure:

1. You're using RPG Maker MV. You can use these assets in other software,
but they are formatted for RPG Maker MV. 

2. You have an unzip program installed to extract the files. 
I use 7zip. 

First, make sure you know what resolution your game is in. 
The base resolution for RPG Maker MV is 816 x 624. 
The primary assets are already formatted for this resolution, 
so if you have not changed your game's resolution, you don't 
need to adjust the images. 

Next, use an unzip program to extract the files into a folder of your choice. 
I would suggest putting them here: 

> This PC > Documents > Games > gameprojectname > img > pictures

Next, open your game project and go to:

> Tools > Resource Manager > Pictures

Now import the files you want into your Resource Manager. 

You're all set!
